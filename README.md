Syncano Pull Request GitHub API Demo
========

An app that demonstrates how to use Syncano's CodeBoxes to create a web app that can read pull requests from the GitHub API.

If you make something neat with Syncano after looking at this basic code, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com or http://www.patcat.com.

Keen for more of this sort of thing? This demo is part of an article at http://www.sitepoint.com.
